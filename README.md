# PInvoke Tool

This project is based on [PInvoke Interop Assistant](https://github.com/jaredpar/pinvoke-interop-assistant)

The main changes being made are along the lines of creating a scriptable P/Invoke code generator. Hopefully, this will do most of the work of taking C/C++ headers and making them in to C# based P/Invokes and types. If you would like a more general tool, please chack out the original project.
